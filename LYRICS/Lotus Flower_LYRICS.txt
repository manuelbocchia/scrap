I willshapemyself into your pocket
Invisible
Do what you want
Do what you want

I willshrinkand I will disappear
I will slip into thegrooveand cut me off
And cut me off

There's anemptyspaceinsidemy heart
Where theweedstake root
And now I'll set you free
I'll set you free

There's anemptyspaceinsidemy heart
Where theweedstake root
So now I'll set you free
I'll set you free

Slowly we unfurl
Aslotusflowers
'Cause all I want is the moon upon a stick
Just to see what if
Just to see what is
I can't kick your habit
Just to fill your fastballooninghead
Listen to your heart

We willshrinkand we'll bequietas mice
Andwhilethe cat is away
Do what we want
Do what we want

There's anemptyspaceinsidemy heart
Where theweedstake root
So now I'll set you free
I'll set you free

'Cause all I want is the moon upon a stick
Just to see what if
Just to see what is
The birdlightsfloat into my room

Slowly we unfurl
Aslotusflowers
'Cause all I want is the moon upon a stick
Idancearound the pit
Thedarknessis beneath
I can't kick your habit
Just to feed your fastballooninghead
Listen to your heart
